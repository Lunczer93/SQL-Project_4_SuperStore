INTRODUCTION
A detailed analysis was performed in all years (2011-2014) and their months regarding Ship Mode, Segment, City, Country, Market, Quantity of Orders, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Product Name and Order Priority.

So, if I find anything interesting then I do not hesitate to bring that in also.
The whole steps of the analysis were described in my project.

View Tables, Temporary tables, Common Table Expressions and Table Variable were created to store data.
JOIN clause was used to combine rows from two or more tables (CTE) based on a related column between them.
Variables were declared in order to store data. It was used to calculate the percentage quantity of selected categories and entities in all years.
A Table-valued functions (TVF) were used to return the data of a table type. It was used to return the result of selected categories in all years.
Scalar functions were used to simplify codes in order to make complex calculations 
A Store procedure was used to store the code in order to show the result of the calculation.
A Pivot was used to rotate a table-valued expression by turning the unique values from one column in the expression into multiple columns in the output.
Data was cleaned by using String Functions
Data was explored by using Analytic and Windows functions
Data was calculated by using Window Functions and Date Functions
